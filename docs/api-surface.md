# API Surface

Documented public API endpoints, intended for both the human dashboard UI and AI agent consumers. This describes the system **as it currently stands** — updated per feature, never pruned or archived.

Every endpoint here is a Next.js App Router route handler under `app/api/**/route.ts` (see [ADR 0004](./decisions/0004-nextjs-api-routes-as-backend.md)). Auth is via Clerk session ([ADR 0005](./decisions/0005-clerk-auth.md)) unless marked public.

## Conventions

- Response envelope: `{ success: boolean, data: <payload> | null, error: string | null }`
- Paginated responses include `meta: { total, page, limit }`
- All endpoints validate input at the boundary and return 4xx with a clear `error` message on invalid input.

## Endpoints

_None yet — no feature has shipped. Entries added per-feature during Phase 4._
