## Conversation Summary

This document summarizes our ongoing conversation regarding the development and debugging of the financial dashboard application, focusing on the settings page functionalities.

### Project Context:
*   **Frontend:** React (Vite)
*   **Backend:** Node.js (Express)
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Image Storage:** Cloudinary
*   **Authentication:** JWT, cookies, OTP for verification

### Key Tasks and Resolutions:

1.  **Settings Page - Account Details Fetch & Update:**
    *   **Initial Problem:** Settings page not loading data.
    *   **Root Cause:** Frontend `axios` call was using an incorrect API path (`/api/v1/me` instead of `/api/v1/user/me`).
    *   **Resolution:** Updated frontend `axios` call to `/api/v1/user/me`.
    *   **Subsequent Problem:** `handleCancel` function undefined.
    *   **Resolution:** Re-added the `handleCancel` function.
    *   **Problem:** Data not persisting after save.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented re-fetching of user data on the frontend after successful save by calling `fetchUserDetails()` in `handleSaveChanges`.

2.  **Settings Page - Profile Image Upload:**
    *   **Initial Problem:** Image upload failing with generic error.
    *   **Root Cause:** `multer` middleware was not correctly processing the `multipart/form-data` or Cloudinary credentials were not being picked up.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Moved `multer` setup to a separate file (`server/config/multerConfig.js`) to resolve "ReferenceError: upload is not defined".
        *   Added `avatar` field to `userModel.js`.
        *   Implemented `updateProfile` in `userController.js` to handle Cloudinary upload.
        *   **Persistent Problem:** "Cloudinary upload failed: Error: Must supply api_key" even after adding keys to `.env`.
        *   **Root Cause:** `process.env` variables were not loaded early enough due to ES Module loading order. `dotenv.config()` was not executing before `userController.js` was initialized.
        *   **Resolution:** Moved `dotenv.config()` to the very top of `server/server.js` (before any imports) to ensure environment variables are loaded at the earliest possible point.
        *   **Problem:** Image disappearing after refresh.
        *   **Resolution:** Populated `profilePhotoPreview` from `data.user.avatar.url` in `useEffect`.
        *   **Problem:** "Save Changes" button not disabling.
        *   **Resolution:** Implemented `isSavingChanges` state to disable the button during upload.

3.  **Settings Page - Email/Phone Re-verification:**
    *   **Initial Problem:** OTP not received, frontend alert misleading.
    *   **Root Cause:** Frontend was not initiating the OTP send request (`send-otp-for-update`) before showing the OTP input.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `handleEditSave` to first call `/api/v1/user/send-otp-for-update` to send OTP, then show the OTP modal.
    *   **Problem:** OTP verification failing with 404.
    *   **Root Cause:** Frontend `verify-otp-for-update` call was using incorrect API path (`/api/v1/verify-otp-for-update` instead of `/api/v1/user/verify-otp-for-update`).
    *   **Resolution:** Updated frontend `axios` call to `/api/v1/user/verify-otp-for-update`.
    *   **Problem:** Phone number edit/verification not needed.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed phone number edit functionality from frontend and ensured it's permanently disabled.

4.  **Settings Page - Notification Preferences:**
    *   **Problem:** Toggle buttons not persisting state.
    *   **Root Cause:** Default values in `userModel.js` were `true`, and frontend `useEffect` was not correctly handling `undefined` values, defaulting to `true`.
    *   **Resolution:** Changed default values in `userModel.js` to `false` for notification preferences. Modified `Notification.jsx` `useEffect` to explicitly default to `false` if values are `undefined` or `null`.
    *   **Problem:** Toggle buttons getting cut off/wrapping incorrectly on small screens.
    *   **Resolution:** Adjusted CSS in `Settings.css` to allow text to wrap within its container and ensure the entire `settings-display-item` wraps as a group when space is limited, preventing cutoff.

5.  **Settings Page - Change Password (Current Issue):**
    *   **Problem:** "Failed to change password. Please try again." with `404 Not Found`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Frontend `axios` call to `/api/v1/user/password/update` is hitting the frontend development server (Vite) instead of the backend, resulting in `index.html` response. This indicates the Vite proxy is not forwarding the request.
    *   **Current Status:** We are in the process of implementing the `updatePassword` function on the backend. The `ReferenceError: updatePassword is not defined` indicates that the function is not yet exported from `userController.js`.

6.  **Login Functionality:**
    *   **Problem:** User unable to log in, with no error message.
    *   **Root Cause:** A CORS issue was preventing the frontend from communicating with the backend. The server's allowed origin was configured via an environment variable (`FRONTEND_URL`) that was not set.
    *   **Resolution:** Hardcoded the frontend's origin (`http://localhost:5173`) in the server's CORS configuration (`server/app.js`) and restarted the server.

7.  **Public Home Page:**
    *   **Request:** Make the home page accessible without a login.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the authentication redirect from `client/src/pages/Home.jsx`.
    *   **Next Step:** Waiting for user feedback to implement sitewide route protection for all pages except the home page, as the previous change made all pages public.

8.  **Sidebar Enhancements:**
    *   **Feature:** Dynamic "Login/Register" / "Logout" option added to sidebar.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented conditional rendering in `Sidebar.jsx` and moved logout logic.
    *   **Layout Fixes:** Addressed overlapping issues by adjusting `App.css` and `Sidebar.css` for proper flexbox layout and spacing. Reverted and re-applied styles multiple times to achieve desired alignment and spacing for sidebar elements.
    *   **Collapsible Sidebar:** Implemented a collapsible sidebar with a toggle button.
        *   **Problem:** Sidebar not collapsing on all screen sizes, content below "Settings" not hiding, and "Settings" and "Logout" buttons going off-page.
        *   **Root Cause:** Incorrect conditional rendering logic (`isMobile` state), incorrect CSS for `main-content` adjustment, and improper positioning of sidebar elements.
        *   **Resolution:**
            *   Removed `isMobile` state and associated `useEffect` from `Sidebar.jsx`.
            *   Restructured `Sidebar.jsx` to ensure all navigation links are always present, and only content below "Settings" (including "Logout/Login" and "Market Status") hides when collapsed.
            *   Adjusted `App.css` to correctly manage `margin-left` of `main-content` based on `layout-container`'s `collapsed` class.
            *   Modified `Sidebar.css` to ensure `sidebar-link-text` hides correctly and `sidebar-hidden-content` transitions smoothly.
            *   Set `sidebar` `top` property to `4rem` to position it correctly below the navbar.
            *   Removed automatic collapse behavior based on screen size, making collapse solely dependent on the toggle button.
            *   Ensured "MarketMitra" title and collapse button are always visible in the sidebar header.

9.  **Navbar Profile Image:**
    *   **Feature:** Display user avatar in Navbar.
    *   **Resolution:** Integrated user context in `Navbar.jsx` and added styling in `Navbar.css`.

10. **Authentication Pages Redesign:**
    *   **Feature:** Unified Login/Register into `Auth.jsx` with new design and password visibility toggle. Redesigned `ForgotPassword.jsx`.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated `Auth.jsx`, `Auth.css`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`, and `ForgotPassword.css`.

11. **Cloudinary Image Deletion:**
    *   **Feature:** Delete old profile images on upload.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `userController.js` to include Cloudinary `destroy` call before new uploads. Added debugging logs.

12. **Project Setup Documentation:**
    *   **Feature:** Created `SETUP.md` for project setup instructions.
    *   **Resolution:** Documented cloning, backend/frontend setup, environment variables, and running the application.

13. **IPO Calendar Table Enhancements:**
    *   **Feature:** Added borders, fade/non-fade background pattern for rows, and conditional row coloring based on IPO date and premium.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented `getRowClass` function in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx` to apply dynamic CSS classes. Updated `client/src/styles/IpoCalendar.css` to include table borders, alternating row backgrounds, and styles for `ipo-status-open`, `ipo-status-closed-not-listed`, `ipo-status-listed`, and `ipo-status-high-premium` classes.

14. **IPO Calendar Filtering and Company Name Trimming:**
    *   **Feature:** Added filter buttons for "All", "Mainboard", and "SME" IPOs, and implemented trimming of "(TENTATIVE DATES)" from company names.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented `filterType` and `filteredIpoData` states, `handleFilterChange` function, and `trimCompanyName` function in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx`. Added styles for filter buttons in `client/src/styles/IpoCalendar.css`.

15. **IPO Calendar Search Functionality:**
    *   **Feature:** Added a search bar to filter IPOs by company name.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented `searchTerm` and `searchedIpoData` states, and `handleSearchChange` function in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx`. Added styles for the search bar in `client/src/styles/IpoCalendar.css`.

16. **IPO Calendar Recommendation and Layout Adjustments:**
    *   **Feature:** Updated "Recommendation" column logic for Mainboard and SME IPOs based on premium, and corresponding cell color coding. Adjusted search bar and filter button layout.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated `getRecommendation` function in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx`. Updated `client/src/styles/IpoCalendar.css` to adjust layout and update styles for recommendation cells.

17. **IPO Calendar Recommendation Logic Refinement:**
    *   **Feature:** Refined the recommendation logic for Mainboard and SME IPOs based on specific premium ranges.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated the `getRecommendation` function in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx` to implement the new premium-based recommendation rules.

18. **IPO Calendar Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Problem:** User reported that previous changes (recommendation logic, search bar border, button centering) were not reflecting.
    *   **Resolution:** Re-verified code changes and provided detailed instructions for clearing browser cache and restarting the development server to ensure the latest updates are loaded.

19. **IPO Calendar Premium Display and Search Bar Background:**
    *   **Feature:** Removed numerical value from premium field, displaying only the percentage. Removed background color from search bar.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx` to extract and display only the percentage from the premium string. Updated `client/src/styles/IpoCalendar.css` to set the search bar background to `transparent`.

20. **IPO Calendar Page Loading and Premium Display Fix:**
    *   **Problem:** Page not loading due to a bug in premium display logic; user also requested to display both premium price and percentage.
    *   **Resolution:** Reverted the premium display logic in `client/src/pages/IpoCalendar.jsx` to show the original `ipo.Premium` string, which contains both price and percentage, and fixed the bug that caused the page to not load.
