"""The fallback-chain orchestrator.

This is deliberately generic: it does not pick one tier per *data type* in
advance. It tries Tier 1 first for a set of named fields, and only asks
Tier 2 / Tier 3 for whichever specific fields Tier 1 didn't return — so a
single logical "get me this company's fundamentals" call can end up with
some fields from Tier 1, some from Tier 2, and some from Tier 3, each
tagged with the tier that actually produced it.

A "resolver" is any zero-argument async callable that returns a dict of
{field_name: value}. It should only include keys for fields it actually
found — omitting a key (or returning None for it) means "didn't have it,
try the next tier."
